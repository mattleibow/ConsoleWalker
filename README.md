# ConsoleWalker

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ty3gj4dfj46cttdl/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mattleibow/consolewalker/branch/master)

A super-simple game of making an ASCII character walk around on a old-school console.

There are come simple controls:

 - left arrow `[⇦]` to move left
 - up arrow `[⇧]` to move up
 - right arrow `[⇨]` to move right
 - down arrow `[⇩]` to move down
 - escape `[esc]` to escape

## Why?

The initial reason for this game was to show my brother how one can easily control the output
of the console - such as to clear and to draw at any location. 

However, this could become something cool for a community project. Maybe we could all add 
little bits (while keeping the app tiny) to make the game more fun. Maybe the bat could 
flutter around, maybe there could be dots to pick up.

Who knows, this may become the next Skyrim?
